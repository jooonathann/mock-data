# mock-data
mock data with a few properties intended to use as practice of data management

To run the program: "node index.js" and choose the number of objects you wanna make


This is how it looks:

  ```
[
  {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Benjamin",
    "lastName": "Nguyen",
    "age": 44,
    "favouriteColor": "Teal",
    "country": "Spain",
    "hobbie": "Gardening",
    "image": "https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/default_profile_4_bigger.png"
  },
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Camila",
    "lastName": "Scott",
    "age": 27,
    "favouriteColor": "orange",
    "country": "Mexico",
    "hobbie": "Inventing",
    "image": "https://blog.za3k.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/default_profile_3_bigger.png"
  }
]
  ```
  
  There are 30 different names, lastNames, ages,favouriteColors, hobbies, 15 different countries and 6 different images. All of them form random objects with these properties
